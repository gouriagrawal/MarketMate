## Introduction

MarketMate is a user friendly “Campus Catalogue application” that allows campus residents to browse menus, place orders from local restaurants available, send files beforehand to available stationaries and easily access up-to-date information about shops and services within the campus. It also allows shops and services to update their information in real-time, ensuring that the information displayed is always accurate and up-to-date.
